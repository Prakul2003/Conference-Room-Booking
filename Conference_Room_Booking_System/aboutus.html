        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            We are the students of IIT Mandi, have taken course named <b>Applied database practicum</b>.
            We are doing project under guidence of our respected professor <b>Varun Dutt</b> sir.
            Our project is about <b> Conference room booking </b>. In this project, we have created 
            a website application where users can register and login with essential information. 
            After login, a user can choose a conference room from the available list of conference 
            rooms on the home page. Faculty login has high priority than that of student login for 
            multiple Rooms and different slots in a day.

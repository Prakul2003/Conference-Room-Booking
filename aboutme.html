        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am a student at IIT Mandi, currently enrolled in the course <b>Applied Database Practicum</b>.
            Under the guidance of my respected professor <b>Varun Dutt</b>, I am working on a project focused on <b>Conference Room Booking</b>.
            In this project, I have developed a web application that allows users to register, log in, and book available conference rooms.
            Faculty members have a higher priority than students when booking multiple rooms or different time slots during the day.
